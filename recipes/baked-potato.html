        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This baked potato has a crisp, golden skin and is light and fluffy on the inside.
            This recipe is incredibly easy and involves <b>seasoning, baking,</b> and <b>topping</b> the potatoes. 
            The baking time for baked potatoes will depend on the size of the potatoes.
            It can take anywhere between <b>50 minutes</b> and <b>1 ½ hours</b>.
            </p>
            <p> The great thing about baked potatoes is that they're so versatile!
            This means you can top them with as many toppings as you like — or as few as you like (there's nothing wrong with a plain spud).
            We love to top our baked potatoes with <b>butter, sour cream, chives, cheese, bacon,</b> and even <b>chili</b>. 
            Let your imagination run wild here!</p>
