        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>This grilled salmon tastes so good!
            A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, 
            with hints of lemon and garlic, 
            are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets.
            Serve with a side of <b>grilled zucchini</b> or <b>grilled corn</b>. This is a great recipe to use when preparing salmon in foil packets. 
            it poaches gently in its on juices and always comes out so tender and delicious!</p>
