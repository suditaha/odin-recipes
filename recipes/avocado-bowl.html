        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Heart health and protein in a bowl! 
         This recipe is an unexpected kick of flavor with <b>egg, red quinoa, avocado,</b> and <b>feta cheese</b>! 
         Very easy to make and a delicious start to the day. 
         Note that this combo over a bed of <b>arugula</b> drizzled with <b>olive oil</b> & <b>vinegar</b> can also make a marvelous lunch meal! </p>

        <p>If you feel like the taste is bland, 
         you can use the recipe as a starter and add ingredients to suit your taste. 
         A quick <b>pico de gallo</b> (tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, cilantro) + <b>black beans</b> can add a little more depth to the flavor and complement the base ingredients nicely.</p>
