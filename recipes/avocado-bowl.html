            <p>Heart health and protein in a bowl! 
            This recipe is an unexpected kick of flavor with <b>egg, red quinoa, avocado,</b> and <b>feta cheese</b>! 
            Very easy to make and a delicious start to the day.

            <p>If you feel like the taste is bland, 
            you can use the recipe as a starter and add ingredients to suit your taste. 
            A quick <b>pico de gallo</b> (tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, cilantro) + <b>black beans</b> can add a little more depth to the flavor and complement the base ingredients nicely.</p>
